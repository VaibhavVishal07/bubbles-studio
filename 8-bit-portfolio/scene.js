   ROOFTOP — the background scene.

   Drawn on a 960x540 canvas and upscaled nearest-neighbour. That is
   how pixel art actually works: a fixed low-resolution grid, blown up
   whole-number style, never drawn at display resolution.

   Techniques, all period-correct:
     - 4x4 ordered (Bayer) dithering for every gradient, glow and haze
     - Three depths of skyline, each generated building by building
       with crowns, mullions, ledges, plant and its own window grid
     - Aerial perspective: each depth is washed toward the horizon, so
       distance is carried by contrast rather than by size alone
     - Window flicker done by repainting individual lit cells, the way
       a tile engine would, rather than redrawing the layer
     - Parallax across five depths, furthest slowest
     - A fixed 12fps tick, so all motion is inherently stepped

   Weather is not an overlay. Rain and snow are read by the *static*
   builders, so a wet roof is a different roof — different deck, different
   coping, different props — and a snowed roof is different again. The
   layers are rebuilt when the weather changes, exactly as they are when
   the theme changes.

     SUPERSAMPLING

     The scene is composed on a 960x540 grid and always will be —
     every coordinate in this file, every landmark, every prop and the
     whole rooftop are authored against it, and re-authoring that is a
     different job from this one.

     What changes here is how many real pixels back each of those
     authored ones. The canvas is S times larger in each axis and every
     drawing context carries a matching transform, so all the code
     below goes on speaking in 960x540 coordinates and does not know
     the difference — but anything that chooses to work at a finer
     grain than one authored pixel now can, and the browser is no
     longer stretching a 960-wide image across a 3200-wide display.

     The thing that immediately cashes this in is the DITHER. Every
     large wash in the scene — the aerial haze on each skyline, the
     city glow, the weather wash, the snow blanket — is an ordered
     dither, and an ordered dither is only as fine as the pixels it has
     to work with. At S=3 those washes get nine times the cells to
     place tone in, so the haze that used to read as a coarse pattern
     laid over the city reads as tone. That is where "more detail"
     actually comes from here: not more things, but the gradients
     between them no longer being chunky.

     S is chosen from how much upscale the display is actually giving
     us, because there is no point rendering three times the pixels
     into a viewport that cannot show them — and because at S=3 the two
     looping city buffers alone are 5760x1620, which is memory a phone
     should never be asked for. */

       buildings, but every gradient, glow and dithered edge resolving
       instead of stepping, so the artwork reads finer and cleaner.

       The 3x buffers are large (the two looping city planes alone are

       turning on   the world swaps, then the fall builds up over five

     LIGHT

     Everything else in this file is dithered, and dithering is the
     right answer for a SURFACE — a hazy sky, a wash over a building,
     snow lying on a ledge. It is the wrong answer for a SOURCE.

     A neon tube's bleed was drawn with the same ordered dither as the
     haze, at a falloff that spent most of its range down in the sparse
     levels, and a sparse ordered dither is a regular lattice. So every
     sign in the city was surrounded by a field of hard single pixels
     in the sign's own colour: not light coming off the glass, static
     sitting next to it. It read as noise because structurally it WAS
     noise — a fixed pattern with no tonal continuity in it.

     Light gets real alpha instead. A radial falloff, composited
     `lighter` so two signs near each other add up the way two lights
     actually do, and no threshold anywhere: at the tube it is bright,
     and it goes smoothly to nothing. This is the one place the project

     WHAT THE CITY SELLS

     This was one list for every skyline, and it was an Indian one —

     a single coherent set of businesses was exactly right.

     With five cities it is exactly wrong, and it is the loudest kind
     of wrong: the signage is the only thing in the frame that uses
     WORDS, so it is doing more to say where you are than the palette
     and the monuments put together. A Tokyo skyline advertising
     tiffin is not a Tokyo skyline.

     So each city brings its own trade. Rules, all of them practical:

       ASCII CAPS ONLY. The 3x5 font is A-Z, 0-9 and a handful of
       punctuation — no accents, so it is CAFE and not café, and
       nothing that needs a character the font has not got.

       SHORT. A billboard is forty pixels across and the code picks
       from whatever fits the wall it is bolted to, so a list with
       nothing under seven characters leaves the narrow towers blank.

       THE TALL LIST IS SHORTER STILL. Vertical signage stacks one
       letter per seven-pixel cell down a thin box; past six letters
       it runs off the bottom of the building.

       REAL TRADES, NO REAL BRANDS. What is actually open at midnight
       on a street like this one.

  /* ==================================================================
     THE WASH

     One row of a large flat gradient — the sky ramp, the aerial haze
     over each skyline, the weather wash, the snow blanket, the mass
     under each parallax plane. Every one of those is a wide, gentle,
     low-contrast field, and it used to be an ordered dither.

     It is a flat alpha now, and the dither is gone from the background
     entirely. That is a real trade and it is worth stating plainly:
     the dither was the period-correct answer, it is what a machine
     with a fixed palette actually did, and on a still frame it looked
     right.

     Three things made it wrong HERE.

     ONE — it is a screen-space pattern over a moving picture. Five
     parallax planes slide past each other continuously; the dither
     does not slide with them, so every plane crawls with a texture
     that belongs to the glass rather than to the city. That is the
     shimmer.

     TWO — the resolution went up. At S=3 the tile is at device-pixel
     pitch, so it stopped reading as a texture with a size and started
     reading as noise with none.

     THREE — the whole scene is composited, not palettised. Nothing
     here is limited to a fixed set of colours, so the dither was
     buying an authenticity the rest of the file never claimed and
     paying for it in stability.

     Alpha is one fillRect a row, so it is also cheaper. */

     COLOUR SHIFT

     Every colour in the palettes below is authored as a flat hex, which
     is right for a fixed palette and wrong the moment you want three
     hundred buildings not to all be the same building. Rather than
     grow a variant of every entry, a colour can be nudged a few points
     per channel at draw time.

     Results are cached, and there are only a few dozen distinct
     (colour, delta) pairs in the whole scene, so the parsing happens
     once per palette per theme and never again.

     of entries.

     The sky ramp was dithered between neighbouring stops, and that is
     what put a screen-door over the entire top half of the frame. An
     ordered dither at a low blend fraction is not subtle — it is a
     perfectly regular lattice, the same handful of pixels lighting up
     in every 8x8 cell across four hundred rows. Sparse and regular is
     the most visible thing a dither can be, which is why the sky read

         cyberpunk is not.

         Cyberpunk is COLD light in a dark place. The city is not lit
         by a sunset behind it, it is lit by itself: mercury vapour,
         argon tubes, a hundred storeys of fluorescent glass throwing
         magenta and cyan up into the smog. So the ramp keeps its
         shape — dark at the zenith, bright at the skyline, all the
         colour down where the buildings are — and rotates the whole
         thing off the red axis onto the violet one.

         Nine stops. Ink blue overhead, through indigo and electric
         violet, into a magenta glow sitting on the rooftops. The red
         is gone entirely; nothing in this sky is warmer than pink. */

         A city at night is not one colour of lit window. It is mostly

         screen and the odd late kitchen scattered through it — and
         that scatter is where nearly all the apparent detail in a
         skyline comes from. One window colour per layer is why the
         towers read as texture rather than as buildings full of
         people.

         Weighted by repetition: the cold base wins most draws, so the
         saturated ones stay rare enough that the neon signs are still
         the loudest thing at each depth. Nearer layers get more of
         them, because that is where you could actually see in. */
      /* ---- the depth ramp ----

         Furthest is lightest and nearest is darkest, which is right for
         a night city: the far towers sit in the glow and the near ones
         are unlit bulk in front of it.

         The nearest layer had taken that to #07020f with a #020007
         shadow — three values inside six points of black. Nothing drawn
         on it could survive: the lit edge, the shadowed edge, the
         mullions, the ledges, the crown steps and the mechanical floor
         were all rendering in colours nothing can tell apart, so a
         tower that has eight separate pieces of structure on it arrived
         as one flat black rectangle.

         Every layer now carries a real interval between fill, lit and
         dark — roughly a doubling up to `lit` and a halving down to
         `dark` — so the same drawing code that was always there has
         values to draw in. The near layer is still the darkest thing in
         the frame and still reads as the nearest; it is just no longer
         a silhouette of itself. */
      /* The glass ramps rotate with the sky. They were built for the

         was a warm one — coral, sodium, ember — and a city whose
         windows are all firelight is a city on fire, not a cyberpunk
         one. The repeated (dominant) entry is now cold on every
         layer: cyan on the near towers, blue-white far away. Warm
         stays in as the RARE draw, one or two slots out of eight,
         which is what makes a lit kitchen at 2am read as a lit

     PARALLAX

     This used to be counted in frames: `-Math.floor(frame / 26)` and
     friends, ticked by the 12fps counter. Which meant the far skyline
     advanced ONE PIXEL EVERY TWENTY-SIX FRAMES — one pixel every 2.2
     seconds, upscaled to nearly two on screen. That is not slow
     motion, it is a still image that lurches, and it is what read as
     jitter: the eye gets nothing at all for two seconds and then a
     jump, which is the exact signature of a dropped frame.

     Two changes fix it, and they have to happen together.

     ONE — speed. Integer-pixel art cannot move smoothly below about
     ten steps a second, because there is no such thing as half a pixel
     and a step you can count is a step you can see. The layers now
     drift in pixels per second, fast enough that the nearest ones step
     ten to twenty times a second and read as continuous drift. The
     city crosses the frame in a minute or two rather than a quarter of
     an hour.

     TWO — the clock. Frames are the wrong unit for this. Speeds are
     authored here in pixels per second and read off elapsed time, so
     the drift is identical on any machine, and — crucially — a layer
     can now step BETWEEN 12fps ticks. The scene still renders its
     content at twelve; it simply also renders when a parallax layer
     has something new to say. The upper bound on that is the fastest
     drift, so this costs about twenty renders a second at worst, not
     sixty.

     Everything else in the scene is still counted in frames and still
     steps at twelve. The stepped identity is in the cat, the fire, the
     window flicker and the train — not in whether the background is
     allowed to move.
     ================================================================== */
  /* Ridge, city 0..2, viaduct — in scene pixels per second.

     The viaduct is ZERO, and that is a correction rather than a
     tuning. Parallax is what a scene does when the CAMERA moves, and
     this camera does not: it is a fixed shot from one rooftop. The
     distant skylines are allowed to drift because at that distance the
     drift reads as the city being alive — cloud shadow, haze moving,
     the sheer scale of it. The elevated line is thirty feet away and
     bolted to the ground. Sliding it sideways said the viewer was
     travelling, which contradicted everything else in the frame, and
     it was the nearest moving thing so it contradicted it loudest.

     The line holds still now. The TRAIN still runs along it, which is
     the only thing on that structure that should ever move. */
  /* Divisors, not speeds. A layer advances one pixel every N frames
     of the 12fps tick, so every step is exactly the same length —
     which is the whole cure for the jitter. Driving this off elapsed
     milliseconds meant steps landed at uneven intervals and the eye
     reads uneven steps as stutter even when the average speed is
     right. Ridge 3px/s, near layer 12px/s. */
  /* ---- Ridge, city 0..3, viaduct ----

     Six entries, because there are five skyline planes now, and every
     one of them slower than it was.

     Five planes drifting at five different rates means SOMETHING in
     the frame steps on almost every tick, and a background that never
     holds still for a whole second is the thing that reads as the
     interface being unstable — even though each individual layer is
     moving perfectly evenly. The fix is not smoother motion, it is
     less of it: the near layer halves from twelve pixels a second to
     six and everything behind it comes down with it, so the frame
     settles between steps instead of always being mid-step.

     eleven separate small movements going at a third speed, which is
     eleven things to ignore instead of eleven things to look at.

     Off is the answer. Every layer from the sky to the deck goes
     under a heavy wash of the darkest colour in the palette, which
     takes the signage, the lit windows, the string lights, the glow
     and the parallax with it. Nothing crosses the sky. Nothing
     flickers.

     scroll positions a second, and for the slow layers a single-pixel
     jump every half second — which is what read as choppy, however clean
     each individual step was.

     Motion is on its own clock now. `scrollT` is seconds of city motion
     elapsed (it advances in loop(), stops in reading mode, and banks
     across a wipe), and each layer's offset comes off that continuously.
     The old per-frame speeds are preserved exactly — a layer that moved
     one pixel every DIV frames at 12fps moves 12/DIV pixels a second — so
     nothing travels faster or slower than before; it just updates far
     more often.

     The offset is still SNAPPED to the device-pixel grid (`* S` then
     round, then back), because a fractional source rect with smoothing
     off would shimmer. So the finest step is one device pixel — three
     times finer than a logical pixel at S=3 — and the compositor repaints
     the instant that step changes rather than waiting for the tick. The

       NOTCH    a wide slab with a slot cut down through the top third,

         There were four, and all four were rectangles: an office slab,
         a thin rectangle, a short wide rectangle, and a rectangle. So
         the skyline was three hundred boxes of varying height, which
         is why every building read as the same building no matter how
         much detail went on its face. Silhouette is the first thing
         the eye reads and the last thing it forgets, and a city where
         every roofline is flat has thrown that away.

         Five more, all of them defined by the shape of their TOP,
         because that is the part that meets the sky:

         BANDED    continuous lit floor strips instead of a window grid
                   - the office slab, the most recognisable shape in
                   the reference after the neon itself.
         NEEDLE    a narrow spire, far taller than its neighbours.
         SLAB      low, wide, nearer the street.
         DOME      a drum with a half-round cap - a capitol, a museum,
                   an observatory that is not the landmark one.
         DRUM      a true cylinder: curved shoulders both sides and
                   vertical shading, the round hotel tower.
         ZIGGURAT  art deco, stepping in hard three or four times.
         PITCHED   a low hall under a peaked roof - a market, a depot,
                   the older stock every real city keeps at its feet.
         BARREL    a low block under a half-round vault, the shed with
                   an arched roof that sits between the towers.
         GRID      the ordinary tower, still the most common thing.

         Picked BEFORE w and h are used, so a needle reshapes itself
         rather than being a normal tower wearing a mast. */
      /* Weighted hard toward DECO.

         Nine archetypes at roughly equal odds gave a skyline with a
         bit of everything in it, which is another way of saying it had
         no character — a barrel vault beside a pitched hall beside a
         drum reads as a sample book, not as a place. A real city has a
         period.

         This one now has an American one: the setback tower is more
         than a third of everything built, and the pitched sheds and
         barrel-vaulted warehouses that were littering the roofline are
         gone from the mix entirely. */

         city that consumed a different number of random numbers here

       t = 0.5 replaces every other pixel, which at this scale is not
       haze, it is a destroyed image: the mullions are one pixel wide,
       the windows are two, and half of every one of them goes. FOG_CAP
       holds the wash below that, so the dither stays a texture laid
       over the buildings rather than a texture that has eaten them.

       TWO — it pools at the base. It used to carry 42% of its strength
       at the very top of the frame, so a tower's crown, its mast and
       its whole upper half were hazed as hard as its feet. Haze is
       densest where the air is thickest, which is at street level, and
       squaring the ramp puts it there: near nothing up high, full
       strength along the skyline. That is what lets a building have a
       readable silhouette and still sit back in the distance. */

     LANDMARKS

     A generated skyline has one problem that no amount of extra
     rendering fixes: every building is the same building. There is
     nothing to point at, so the eye slides off it.

     What fixes it is not more detail — it is a few shapes you can
     *name*. A ferris wheel, a clock tower, a pagoda, a crane, a dome.
     Each one is deliberately plain, because a landmark has to read as
     itself in a single glance at a hundred pixels tall, and anything
     fussy at that size just turns back into skyline.

     They are drawn into the parallax buffers with the buildings, before
     the aerial wash, so they sit at their layer's depth and come round
     with everything else.

     These used to be cameos — a Triforce that assembled itself in mid

     rose out of nowhere. They read as stickers, because that is what
     they were: things happening AT the city rather than in it.

     So they are buildings now. A Triforce is a neon sign, and a city
     full of neon signs is exactly where one belongs; it hangs on a
     roof with a lattice under it and a halo bleeding onto the wall
     behind it, drawn by the same code that draws RAMEN 24H, and it
     parallaxes with the layer it is standing on. Nobody is told it is
     there. You either catch it on the skyline or you do not, which is
     the only way an easter egg is worth anything.

     MONUMENTS

     The landmarks above are archetypes: a ferris wheel, a clock tower,
     a crane. They give the eye something to catch on, but they belong
     to no particular city — which is exactly right for an invented one
     and exactly wrong the moment the scene claims to be somewhere.

     These are the other kind. Each one is a building a person could
     name, drawn at the smallest size its silhouette survives, because
     that is the whole test: if you have to be told which city you are
     looking at, the monument has failed and no amount of detail on it
     will help.

     Rules they all follow:

       SILHOUETTE FIRST. Every one of these is recognised by its
       outline before any surface detail arrives, so the outline is
       drawn first and the detail is only ever allowed to sit inside
       it. A Chrysler crown with the wrong number of arches still
       reads; a Chrysler crown with the right arches and a soft edge
       does not.

       ONE STEP ABOVE THE NOISE. They outline in `o.window`, the
       brightest structural colour the layer has, for the same reason
       the archetypes do — a monument drawn in the values of the
       towers beside it is just more skyline.

       LOCAL COLOUR IS EARNED. Most of them take the layer's palette.
       The few that do not — verdigris on Liberty, vermilion on a
       torii, the red-and-white banding on Tokyo Tower — are the cases
       where the colour IS the recognition, and those are only ever
       placed in the near layers, where the aerial wash is weak enough
       to leave them alone.

  /* ---- a cherry tree in flower ----

     The hard part of blossom at this size is that it is neither a
     shape nor a texture — a solid pink blob is a lollipop and scattered
     pink pixels are noise. What works is clumps: three or four dense
     clusters with dark gaps between them, each one lit on its upper
     left, so the canopy reads as mass with light coming through it. */
  /* ---- the cherry tree ----
     It was five filled circles round a fork: a blob, and at this size
     a blob of pink is a bush, a cloud or a smudge depending on what
     you were expecting.

     A tree reads as a tree because of its BRANCHING — a trunk that
     divides, divides again, and thins as it goes — and blossom reads
     as blossom because it is made of separate flowers with gaps of
     sky between them, not a continuous field of pink.

     So this draws the structure first: a tapering trunk, then limbs
     recursed three deep with a deterministic wobble on each, and the
     tips collected as it goes. Then every tip gets a handful of
     florets, and a floret is an actual five-petal flower — four petals
     round a hot centre — rather than a pixel of pink. A few leaves go
     in among them, because a cherry in full flower still has some.

     Nothing here rolls a die: the wobble and the scatter are both
     functions of position, so the same tree comes back every build. */

     the city, because a landmark is one building and the other four
     hundred were the same generic mat every other city here is made
     of.

     What actually makes a Tokyo street read as Tokyo is the clutter on
     it: the overhead cable, strung pole to pole because almost nothing
     is buried; the steel water tank up on legs on every mid-rise roof;
     the external stair bolted to the outside of the building because
     the plot was too narrow to put one inside. None of those are
     landmarks. All of them are unmistakable.

     So this section is furniture, and it is drawn ACROSS the layers
     rather than at one spot — which is the point. A landmark you look
     at; furniture you read the city through.

     AERIAL PERSPECTIVE, DONE IN THE PALETTE

     Depth was being carried entirely by a dithered wash laid over each
     finished layer, and that wash had to be kept weak or it turned the
     city into a checkerboard. Weak wash, no separation: four skylines
     sitting at almost the same value, which is exactly what "flat"
     looks like.

     The fix is to stop asking the dither to do it. Every colour a
     layer is built FROM is blended toward the horizon before a single
     building is drawn — so the far city is genuinely made of paler,
     lower-contrast material, not the near city with fog on top of it.
     No pixels are spent, nothing is thresholded, and the separation
     can now be as strong as the picture needs because it costs no
     texture at all.

     The `glass` array recedes with everything else. Lit windows that

     separate from the shadowed edge of the tower it abuts — so a row of
     same-material towers reads as one dark wall rather than as buildings.

     `depthen` widens the fill→lit and fill→dark intervals along their

     definition. It runs BEFORE the aerial wash, and its strength scales

     CITIES

     Five of them, and swapping between them rebuilds the skyline the
     same way a weather change does — same staged queue, same dissolve.

     What actually differs is smaller than it looks, and deliberately
     so. The archetypes, the window grids, the neon, the parallax and
     the whole rooftop in front are shared, because they are what makes
     this read as ONE scene rather than five wallpapers. A city is
     three things on top of that:

       ITS MONUMENTS, which is nearly all of the recognition. Five or
       six named buildings per city, spread far enough round the 1920px
       loop that one or two are in frame at a time.

       ITS LIGHT. Manhattan is magenta and cyan; Tokyo in April is
       rose; New Delhi is sodium through smog; Paris is gold; Dubai
       is gold over a hot teal. Each city overrides a handful of
       palette entries — the sky ramp, the haze, the neon set — and
       inherits everything else from the theme.

       ITS STOCK. A hint, through the archetype mix: Manhattan steps,
       Dubai spikes, Paris is low and even. Handled by `shape`, which
       nudges the roll in buildCity rather than replacing it.

     Everything is keyed off `cityKey`. Nothing else in the file needs
     to know which city it is drawing.

     Doubled, and the doubling is nearly all in `step`.

     Total windows across a layer works out as (building height) over
     (step squared) — the building WIDTH cancels, because a narrower
     tower has fewer windows on it and there are proportionally more
     towers. So the only lever that actually multiplies the pixel count
     in a skyline is the window pitch, and it multiplies it as the
     square: every layer's step comes down by about a third, which is
     twice the windows, twice the mullions and twice the floor ledges
     on every face in the frame.

     Widths come down alongside it, by a quarter rather than a half.
     That is worth a third again as many buildings — more silhouette,
     more crowns, more setbacks against the sky — without turning the
     near layer into a row of posts, which is what halving them did.

     The window CELLS shrink to match, because a 2px window on a 3px
     pitch is a solid lit wall. Near layer 3x3 to 2x3, mid 2x3 to 2x2,
     far 2x2 to 1x2. Smaller cells and twice as many of them is exactly

     THE DEPTH RAMP

     Four built skylines behind the ridge, not three.

     Three planes plus a ridge gave four distances, and four was one
     short in exactly the place it shows: there was a visible JUMP
     between the far layer sitting in the haze and the mid layer
     standing clear of it. Depth in a flat picture is carried by the
     number of steps between the nearest thing and the furthest, and
     any step big enough to notice is a step that reads as a cut-out
     pasted in front of a backdrop.

     Five planes now — ridge, far, mid-far, mid, near — and every one
     of them is a genuine step on four axes at once, which is what
     makes it read as distance rather than as four heights:

       RECEDE   how far the palette is blended toward the horizon
                before a single brick is drawn. 0.5 at the ridge to
                nothing at all on the near layer.
       FOG      the dithered wash laid over the finished layer, on top
                of that.
       DRIFT    how fast it crosses. 2px/s at the back, 12 at the front.
       STOCK    smaller and denser with distance.

     The buildings themselves get the pitch down another step wherever
     there is room for it, which is the rest of the detail: every layer
     from the ridge forward now carries a 3px window grid rather than
     4, 5 or 7, so a tower has roughly twice the cells on its face that
     it had and the whole skyline stops reading as texture at any
     distance you look at it. */

       These two planes kept collapsing into one. The roof and the
       skyline can land on the same value — badly in day, worst of all
       under snow, where the deck goes pale AND the city is washed pale
       by the snow light, so the two meet with nothing between them.

       Two things fix it, and it needs both:

       1. There WAS a dithered band of haze here — twenty-four rows of
          `sep` laid over the city immediately above the parapet, at up
          to 0.5 dry and 0.66 under snow, meant to lift the background
          away from the foreground's value.

          It is gone. Both of those amounts are at or past the
          checkerboard, so what it actually put on screen was a solid
          slab of alternating pixels twenty-four rows deep, running the
          full width of the frame, sitting exactly across the bottom
          storeys of the near city — which is where the street-level
          signage is. Every sign down there was being read through it.
          It was the single largest patch of pure noise left in the
          scene and it was destroying the most legible thing in it.

          The job it was supposedly doing is done properly, and with
          one flat line instead of a field of dither, by the rim
          below. */

    /*  2. The single most important line in the whole scene: a hard,
          near-black rim along the very top of the coping, in a colour
          used for nothing else so it can go as dark as it needs to. A
          silhouette edge is what separates a foreground from a
          background in pixel art, and three pixels was not enough of
          it once the coping could be covered in snow. */

    g.fillRect(0, capY - 6, W, 6)

    /* ---- the catch light ----

       This one line is doing more work than everything else on the
       parapet put together.

       The problem was never that the roof and the city were the wrong
       values — it was that at the seam between them there was nothing
       for the eye to LOCK onto. Two dark planes meeting at a dark edge
       is one plane. What separates a foreground in any picture drawn
       this way is a hard bright rim along its topmost surface: the
       near thing catches the light that the far thing is generating,
       and the moment that line exists the two stop being the same
       distance away.

       So the coping now goes near-black immediately above (six pixels
       of `edge`, up from four), then a single bright pixel of catch
       along its very top, then its lit face, its front, its undercut.
       Reading down: shadow, light, mid, dark. Four values in twelve
       pixels, and the picture gains a foreground. */

     Toggling the rain rebuilds every static layer, because rain
     changes them: the sky carries a wash, the roof is wet, and the

     and it is also about 134ms of synchronous canvas work — eight
     frames dropped in a row, landing at the exact moment the weather
     changes, which is the exact moment you are watching. That stall
     was the jitter. Not the ramp, not the dissolve: a hang.

     So the work is queued instead, one piece per frame, and the
     dissolve snapshot is HELD over the top while it drains. The
     snapshot is a picture of the world as it was, so the fact that the
     layers underneath are half old and half new for a few frames is
     invisible — and the falling weather is on its own canvas at 60fps,
     so the frame never actually freezes. When the queue empties the
     dissolve is released and plays out normally.

  /* ---- Water on the glass ----
     The panel is the one surface in the scene facing the viewer, so
     rain hitting it does not splash and vanish — it sticks. Beads sit
     on the pane, and every so often one gets heavy enough to run,
     sweeping up the beads it passes and leaving a clean track behind
     it. That track is the whole effect: a streak nobody has wiped.

     Everything is held in normalised panel space, 0 to 1 across and
     down, so the water stays on the window when the viewport changes
     shape instead of sliding off it.

     Two rules govern it.

     WHERE. Only the outer sixth of the pane, each side. Water tracking
     across a line of type makes the type harder to read and starts
     looking like dirt on the screen rather than weather on a window, so
     the middle is left alone entirely.

     HOW. A drop on glass does not slide, it creeps. Surface tension
     pins it; it builds until it tears loose, runs a little way, picks
     up whatever it touches, gets heavier and faster for it, and pins
     again. So a runner carries a mass, accelerates from nothing, stalls
     at intervals, and only reaches its top speed once it has swept up a
     few beads on the way down. Drops moving at a constant speed were
     the whole reason the first attempt read as rain drawn on top of a
     window instead of water sitting on one. */

     band of its own darkest value — the undifferentiated mass of city
     at that distance — so a gap between near towers shows the layer

     SEPARATING THE NEAR PLANE

     The rooftop and the city behind it were sitting in the same space.
     Not because the values were wrong — the layers recede properly now
     — but because there was nothing marking the BOUNDARY between the
     furthest thing you are standing in and the nearest thing you are
     looking at. Two planes at similar value with a hard edge between
     them read as one flat picture with a line on it, which is exactly
     what was happening.

     Real depth at that boundary comes from two things, and both are
     gradients, and both were impossible here until light got real
     alpha. Now that it has:

     ONE — the city falls into shadow as it comes down to meet the
     parapet. Distance does not only desaturate, it also darkens at the
     base where the air is thickest and no light is getting out. A
     smooth fall into `edge` over the last fifty pixels does more to
     push the skyline back than any amount of haze on the buildings
     themselves, because it is the only cue in the frame that says
     "this stops here and something else starts".

     TWO — the deck recedes. A rooftop seen from standing height is a
     plane going away from you, so it is darkest at the far edge and
     opens up toward your feet. It was painted at one flat value from
     the parapet to the bottom of the frame, which is a wall, not a
     floor.

     Both are drawn as linear gradients rather than dithered, and that
     is deliberate: a dither is a texture, and a texture laid over the
     most detailed part of the picture is what caused every problem
     this scene has had. These are pure value, no pattern, invisible as
     an effect and only legible as space. */

     This replaced, in order, a step sequencer, a drawing pad, a
     falling-block puzzle and a rooftop runner — and the reason it beat
     all four is that it has no rules, no failure state, nothing to
     learn and nothing to read. You click, and something lovely
     happens, and you understand the whole thing before the first one
     has finished bursting. Every one of the others needed a sentence
     of explanation first, and a portfolio is not a place anybody has
     agreed to be taught something.

     It is also the only one that happens IN the city rather than in a
     box on the page. That is the thing worth showing off here: the
     backdrop is a program, so it can answer you.

     Each shell is a rise, a burst and a fall. Thirty sparks on a
     circle, each with its own drag, all of them fading through the
     same three-stop ramp — hot core, sign colour, ember — which is
     what makes a burst read as burning rather than as a scatter of

     As physics that is correct and as an interaction it is broken: a
     direct manipulation that takes two seconds to answer does not read
     as a slow firework, it reads as a page that did not hear you.

     Five frames now, and the shell starts a fixed short distance
     BELOW the burst point rather than at the horizon, so the wait is
     the same wherever you tap and it is under half a second. That is
     still long enough to read as a launch — you see the tail go up —
     and short enough that the burst feels like the answer to the tap

     Every position is a function of `frame` rather than an

     It is a real fade now, and the reason is the same one that applied

     at every level between the ends: erode a whole frame through it
     and what you see is not a picture becoming another picture, it is
     a grid crawling across the screen. At sixty frames a second that
     grid is the most obviously moving thing in the transition, which
     is precisely backwards — a transition's job is to be the one thing
     you do not notice.

     bands, each stretched a little wider the nearer it is to the
     centre line, and nudged vertically by the same curve.

     fractional ratio — with smoothing disabled, so nearest-neighbour
     duplicated whichever columns happened to fall on the seams. A
     different set of columns per band, at a fractional vertical offset,
     re-resampled every frame, and then the browser upscaled the result
     to the viewport at a second fractional ratio. Two stacked
     non-integer resamples is precisely how a hard-edged picture turns
     into a soft one, and no amount of `image-rendering: pixelated`
     downstream can undo it: the damage is already baked into the
     buffer by the time CSS sees it.

     So the frame is presented 1:1 now — one blit, whole pixels, the
     grid intact all the way to the CSS upscale. The curved-glass
     reading is carried by the `.crt` overlay instead, which does it
